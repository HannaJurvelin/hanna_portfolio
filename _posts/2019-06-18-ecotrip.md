An illustration for a campaign that marketed a biking trip to the young people of Helsinki. I drew an illustration based on the wishes of a group of youths, who came up with the idea and executed the campaign, with funding from RuutiBudjetti. Here are the two versions of the illustration: the original and the official design. The first illustration felt too autumnal for the clients, so I changed the colors to a more spring-like feeling and did some other changes as well. The marketing channels used were social media, print and public transportation. Link: nuortenymparistotila.munstadi.fi/ecotrip-pyoraleiri/
