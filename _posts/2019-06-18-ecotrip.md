An illustration for a campaign that marketed a biking trip to the young people of Helsinki. I drew an illustration based on the wishes of a group of youths, who came up with the idea and executed the campaign, with funding from RuutiBudjetti. Here are the two versions of the illustration: the original and the official design. The marketing channels used were social media, print and public transportation.
