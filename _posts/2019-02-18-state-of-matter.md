State of Matter is a mobile game by Kaamos Games published for Android and iOS devices in 2016. Itâ€™s a 2D-platformer game where you solve puzzles and fight enemies by changing states. The style of the game is very cute and colourful.

I designed multiple things for the game, including the characters, the enemies, backgrounds, the logo and the user interface. I also did most of the animations for the game. I was also in charge of making concept art and promotional material.
